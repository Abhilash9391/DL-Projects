🧠 Deep Learning Projects

This repository contains my deep learning projects. Currently, it includes:

🐱🐶 Cat vs Dog Image Classification

Implemented using TensorFlow/Keras.

Achieved 80% accuracy with a CNN model trained from scratch.

Improved to 90% accuracy using Transfer Learning (VGG16) with data augmentation.
